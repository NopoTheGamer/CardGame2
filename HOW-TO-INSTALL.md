# System requirements

The game should realistically run on any computer that has Java 17 installed

This guide will get Java 17 and the game downloaded to your computer

This does not install the Java runtime environment system-wide on your computer

# Info

School wifi blocks github releases for me, could be an issue
The install script does work on school wifi for me though

# Automatic Install
#### I recommend running this in an empty folder, makes like 4 files/folders

Download https://github.com/NopoTheGamer/CardGame2/releases/download/2/Installer.py and run it with python

The script will download the required file and run the game for you

If it doesn't work for what ever reason you can manually install it

# Manual Install

Download the game jar from: https://github.com/NopoTheGamer/CardGame2/raw/master/game.jar

Download the Java JDK from:
[Windows](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_windows-x64_bin.zip)
[Mac](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_macos-x64_bin.tar.gz)
[Linux](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz)

Extract the JDK in the folder you are in 

Open the "jdk-17.0.8" folder and open the "bin" folder

Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) in the folder you are in

Drag the "javaw.exe" file (Windows) "java" file (Mac/Linux) into the Command Prompt/Terminal 

Type " -jar" after the file name

Drag the game.jar file into the Command Prompt/Terminal

The Command should look something like `path\to\folder\jdk-17.0.8\bin\javaw.exe -jar path\to\folder\CardGame2-master\game.jar`

Click enter and the game should start
