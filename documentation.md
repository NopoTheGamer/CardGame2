# Define the problem

## Identification of the problem

I will be creating a software solution as a video game. This game will be a turn based card game with 5 lanes that can be either water or land. There will be 3 types of cards. “Troop” - your attacking card that can be placed on the battlefield. “Power” - used on your troops to give them buffs such as higher attack power or a special ability such as double strike. “Environment” - A card that gets placed on the ground and generally either activates before attacking in that lane or provides some permanent buff as long as that environment is placed there. The game is currently planned to have a few levels that have variating water lanes and cards that your enemy will have. 

## Idea generation

## Communication with others involved in the proposed system 

## Researching and evaluating the other solutions 

## Investigating methods, languages, platforms for suitability 


# Understand the problem

## Outline the purpose of the solution 
	Developer perspective 
		Justify the software development approach(es)
		Justify the selection of languages and approach
		List the main elements
		List any additional elements 

## User perspective
	Explain how the user interacts with the solution 
	List main considerations for using the solution 
		Consistency
		Aesthetics
		Help
		Navigation 
	
## Communication with others involved in the proposed solution
	Meeting notes with the teacher 

## Representing the system using diagrams 
	Context diagram 
	Data Flow diagram
	Systems flowchart
	Structure charts

## Selection of appropriate data structures for the solution 
	Input processing outputs 
	Arrays, records, variables 

## Justification of all third party libraries and addons
	Identify the plugin or addon 
	Explain the use or benefit in the solution
	Compare alternatives
	Justify the choice 

## Applying project management techniques 
	Gantt chart 
	Github 
	Explicit method of measuring time spent on
